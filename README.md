## Overview

The users are able to:
- Add new todos - if they try to submit an empty form, they will receive an error.
- Mark todos completed and then make them active again.
- Delete single todos.
- Delete all of the compeleted todos in a bulk.
- See how much items they have left/completed.
- Filter between all todos, active todos and complete todos.
- Drag and drop the todos to reorder the list.
- Toggle between light and dark mode - initial mode is set up based on the user's preferences.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
